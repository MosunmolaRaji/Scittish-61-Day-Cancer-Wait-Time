# Scottish-61-Day-Cancer-Wait-Time
 This project is about getting insight from the Cancer Wait Time - 62 Day Standard data set  of the Public Health Scotland using Micrososft Excel funtionalities.
 # Introduction
 The importance of data analysis in every area of life cannot be over-emphasized. In the health sector, it is applied in all possible areas including tracking, referring and treatment of cancer. This project is centred on exploring cancer referral waiting times in Scotland. This waiting time can either be 31-day or 62-day waiting times; each having separate data sets. The project aims to harness the capabilities of Excel in data analysis turning raw data into actionable insight that supports decision-making and gives recommendations for reducing cancer-related cases.

Data projects begin with data sources. The data set used for this project is the 62-day waiting time data set obtainable through this link. 

The data set is available under the UK Open Government License (OGL). Also available are options to download the file in different formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, and XML, and a data dictionary describing the fields and other information about the data set. The data dictionary also contained links to other re-useable data sets useful for the project.
# Data Storage
The Cancer Wait Time - 62 Day Standard data set was downloaded as a CSV file and stored in a labelled folder on a local machine. Also, Health Board 2014 - Health Board 2019 data set was downloaded as a CSV via the data dictionary and stored in the same folder.
