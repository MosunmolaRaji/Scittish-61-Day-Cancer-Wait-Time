# Scottish-61-Day-Cancer-Wait-Time
 This project is about getting insight from the Cancer Wait Time - 62 Day Standard data set  of the Public Health Scotland using Micrososft Excel funtionalities.
 # Introduction
 The importance of data analysis in every area of life cannot be over-emphasized. In the health sector, it is applied in all possible areas including tracking, referring and treatment of cancer. This project is centred on exploring cancer referral waiting times in Scotland. This waiting time can either be 31-day or 62-day waiting times; each having separate data sets. The project aims to harness the capabilities of Excel in data analysis turning raw data into actionable insight that supports decision-making and gives recommendations for reducing cancer-related cases.  
# Workflow Overview

# Data Source
Data projects begin with data sources. The data set used for this project is the 62-day waiting time data set obtainable from the website of the public health Scotland via (https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/cancer-waiting-times/resource/23b3bbf7-7a37-4f86-974b-6360d6748e08). 
The data set is available under the UK Open Government License (OGL). Also available are options to download the file in different formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, and XML, and a data dictionary describing the fields and other information about the data set. The data dictionary also contained links to other re-useable data sets useful for the project.
# Data Storage
The Cancer Wait Time - 62 Day Standard data set was downloaded as a CSV file and stored in a labelled folder on a local machine. Also, Health Board 2014 - Health Board 2019 data set was downloaded as a CSV via the data dictionary and stored in the same folder.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation
The Get Data function from the Data Tab in Excel was used to load the data sets into Power Query Editor for profiling, cleaning, and transformation. Power query editor is a powerful tool in some Microsoft packages including Excel that is useful in connecting different data sources and transforming them to meet analysis and analytics needs. Data profiling involves understanding the data set by studying fields and the data types. The cleaning and transformation involve manipulating and preparing the data for analysis while preserving the quality of the data. The step is important to ensure the data is right for meaningful insights to be derived from it.

# Data Modelling
The transformed data was loaded into a data model and a relationship was established between them in Excelâ€™s Power Pivot. Power pivot is a powerful modelling technology that enables data model creation, relationship establishment and calculations within data tables.

# Data Analysis and Insights
A pivot table was inserted with the data model.  A Pivot Table is a powerful tool for calculating, summarizing, and analysing data in Excel. It allows for easy identification of comparisons, patterns, and trends, leading to data-driven insights. After a pivot table had been generated, pivot charts and other Excel recommended charts were derived to gain insight into the data sets.
